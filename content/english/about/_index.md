FRANTIC! Software is a one man band based in Minnesota. I, Jacob Leuthardt, the CEO, Founder, Lead dev, everything, have written every single line myself since day one. It's been hard, and it's only going to get harder, and thats what i live for. I have big plans for FRANTIC! Software. Employees, a real office, profits, branching out into new industries, etc. I just hope that you follow me through my plans.
