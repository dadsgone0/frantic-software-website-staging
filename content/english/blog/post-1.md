We have completely overhauled the site from being hand-coded to now using Hugo, which means everything will scale better, be smoother, and make the user experience even better. We've also re-designed our logo and color palatte to look more flat and professional, instead of the brown and ketchup-mustard nightamre.

### What are we working on right now?

Well, for starters, FRANTIC! Linux has been scrapped. Honestly, I don't know enough about Linux to really even do a respin, let alone create a whole disto with constant support. That paves the way for new innovations though!

IN PROGRESS:  
Cloud Store Standard  
Website improvements  
Satellite CDN  

NOT CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON:  
Cloud Media Tools (CMT)  
API  
RenderCloud  
Cloud Store Archival  

THOUGHTS ON FUTURE SERVICES:  
FRANTIC! OnSite. I could honestly do a whole blog post on this specific thought, because it's so fleshed out and cool. It's a distant thought though, i'd need a lot of money. Anyways, OnSite would be servers that would be hand built and meant for a local version on Cloud Store (more meant for enterprise users)  
FRANTIC! Typewriter. A competitor to Microsoft Word and Google Docs, with a local and web version availible. 

Note: This is not a timeframe or anything of the sorts. It is just to show whats currently being worked on.
